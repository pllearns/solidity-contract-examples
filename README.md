# solidity-contract-examples

A series of .sol files that is meant as a reference for all of the different types of solidity contracts that I have created, and that I have seen or played with through tutorials. 

## Use Remix

Especially when starting on programming with solidity. There are a lot of great tools in the UI of this IDE and you can deploy these contracts to test nets and rpcs in advance of putting them on the main network. 

### Prerequisites

I would also recommend that when you start creating contracts in your code editor of choice that you use a solidity support package that uses syntax highlighting, snippets, and compilation. I use VSCode and this is the support package I use: [solidity package by Juan Blanco] (https://github.com/juanfranblanco/vscode-solidity)

### Installing

I will be updating this section with specific ways that you can interact with your contracts, including web3.js, truffle, etc.
